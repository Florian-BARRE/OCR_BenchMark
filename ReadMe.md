# OCR_Benchmark

This repository contains a script designed to benchmark various Optical Character Recognition (OCR) models. The script downloads an OCR dataset and evaluates the accuracy of each model. The main goal is to provide a comparative analysis of different OCR solutions based on their performance in recognizing text from the dataset.

By running this benchmark, you can easily assess how well different OCR models perform in terms of accuracy, allowing for informed decisions when choosing an OCR solution for specific tasks.
